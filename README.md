##the second container
when you open it, it will be a little messy and confusing, but don't worry i got you back
you can change the color of this container and make it also change its color automaticaly
to 10 or less different colors you choose and  the period of time you want like this:

click on each of these input fields and you can see a bunch of colors choose one of them
and then to the next one do the same thing, and choose a different color (optional)
and then to the next one and the next one utill you've choosed 10 different colors
(or not necessery 10,but at least a few ones)
and then choose the time it takes for the container to loop through all of these colors
and the input of the time will be like this
2s
10s
60s
0.5s

i know that this is a little bit confusing, but if you get stuck there is a tutorial button that if you click on it will show you what you need to do
